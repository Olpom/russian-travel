          <h2 class="intro__title">What have we not seen there?</h2>
          <p class="intro__text">According to VCIOM surveys 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere but only 36% plan to spend a holiday in their home country. Like, what haven't we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe, with the gentle seas of the south, the thick forests of the Sayan Mountains and the rugged ice of the Putorana Plateau. And yet you can see all these beauties without millions in your bank account, an international passport or hours of flying. Just like Vera Bashmakova, a brave young mother who took her three children along with her, took them in her Lada and drove 20,000 kilometres across her home country. We have chosen and described some interesting places worthy of your holiday.</p>

            <p class="place__paragraph">Amidst the forests and sand dunes, you can see two water horizons - the calm Curonian Lagoon on one side and the rippling waves of the Baltic Sea on the other. A unique natural area on the edge of the Russian enclave.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The Kaliningrad region does not end there. For the traveller and explorer there is also the area next door to Russia's westernmost point, the Baltic Spit, and the German heritage of a scattering of small seaside towns. The atmosphere here eliminates the hustle and bustle, enveloping you in the tranquillity of nature and the smell of the steely, cool sea.</p>

            <p class="place__paragraph">Perhaps you have watched Zvyagintsev and even heard the story of the Arctic festival in Teriberka. Perhaps the word "Khibiny" has not remained under the snow of your school geography class memories. Perhaps you are not interested in superdeep borehole penetrating the Earth's crust and apatites have been making you apathetic for a long time. But your dream to see the northern lights is starting to come true when you get a ticket to Murmansk.</p>

          <div class="place__description">
            <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you'll see slopes lined with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open the windows in the car, you can experience the invisible wonder of the area - the mountain air.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">Altai has a temperate climate, so it's best to travel here in summer. This allows you to see the diversity of the local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous Pallas' cats are also inhabitants of the Altai region.</p>

            <p class="place__paragraph">Everyone knows Baikal as the largest lake in the world. Many people also know that it is the biggest source of fresh water and one of the most beautiful places in Russia.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">Certainly this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for skijoring competitions. That's a sport where a skier straps himself to a motorbike and the tandem tries to get as fast as possible on the ice. In March 2019 a world record of 197.011 km/h was set at the Baikal Mile Festival.</p>

            <p class="place__paragraph">Siberia does not end in the Urals but in Karelia: the Siberian larch, which forms the taiga, does not grow west of Vodlozero. But here it reaches up to 30 metres - the forests in Karelian national parks have never known an axe because of the impassable bogs. Some pines are more than half a millennium old. Touch a living creature that has seen the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it. You will not find a path in a virgin forest for a hundred kilometres. And on rare paths, trees a few metres from the ground are marked with bear claws. So everyone knows who's boss.</p>
